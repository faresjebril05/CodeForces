# Codeforces Problemset Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various problemsets from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

Each solution represents problems I have attempted and solved on the platform. The repository is updated periodically as I continue to solve more problems.

## 📌 Contents

- ✅ Solutions are organized by problem name or contest ID.  
- 📄 Each file includes a clear and concise implementation.  
- 🛠️ The programming language used is primarily **[e.g., C++, Java, C]**.

## 🔄 Updates

I will keep adding new solutions from time to time as I progress through more problems on Codeforces.  
Feel free to check back regularly!

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the solutions locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/faresjebril05/CodeForces.git`

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory and run the file using the relevant compiler or interpreter.
